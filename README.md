# EIP-2981 Example

Simple example of implementation of upcoming EIP-2981

The contract `./contracts/mocks/ERC721WithRoyalties.sol` shows how to extend ERC2981 and how to set royalties at minting time.

In this implementation, royalties are expected to be from 0 to 10000 which allows to define royalties with 2 decimals.
